# Sentiment-snslysis-of-kannada-product-reviews-using-BERT
the above project shows a simple way of finetuning a BERT model for sentiment analysis  
in the following project the BERT model has been fine tuned for sentiment analysis of kannada reviews 

# The dataset used has been refered from ai4bharat/IndicSentiment repository
from where the kannada reviews and the sentiment labels are extracted and used in the project

# The project also demonstrates the practical use of the Trained BERT model
by integrating the Trained BERT model with a user interface where one can analyze the sentiment of a single review or a batch of reivews can be analyzed by providing txt file containing each review line by line
